< Hi, my name is Matheus Sorrentino, i'm currently seventeen. />

< I love programming and the first language I learned was Python 🐍, which I fell in love with, and I study it until today. />

< Some mottos that I take to my life: />

< 1️⃣ Giving up is never an option. 💪/>

< 2️⃣ Think, reflect and act 🧠/>

< 3️⃣ Organization gives you time 🕒>


< I still don't have a job, however, I study a lot so that the day the opportunity arises I can take advantage of it in the best way 👌. I am currently studying web development to become a Full Stack developer and studying machine learning with python, as I believe that in the near future this knowledge will be extremely important. 😅/>

< Well, about what I can collaborate on projects, I tell you that in everything, as long as there is time for me to familiarize myself with the technologies and languages ​​that will be used. I will always do my best to achieve my goals and those of my team!  />

< I am open to learning and teaching, if necessary. 📚/>
< If you notice that I know something that you are having trouble learning, contact me on my social networks and I will try to help you in the best way I can! />

< Let's build a more friendly and collaborative community! 🌱/>
